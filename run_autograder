# The following line is needed for this reason:
# we have just pulled a new version of the course project,
# which has the autograder as a dependency.
# If we update the version of the autograder in that project,
# `run_autograder_main` may change.
# So we need to make sure that the latest versions of the dependencies are present
# before we copy that file over.
